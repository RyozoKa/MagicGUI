This is a simple explanation of how a theme definition file works.
It's very simple actually. Each textured action has a corresponding ID

The syntax for that is simply:

C_BUTTON_DOWN = "Path/To/Texture.png"

To get a list of all the supported IDs,
please refer to ThemeManager.h or a default theme
